### Supermarket_Project

# GOAL:

2Market seeked to understand their customer demographic while advancing their understanding on which advertising channels and products are most popular with them. In this report I addressed these questions and, using the knowledge I found, proposed some further questions that will require more complex data to solve. 

To start I will pose the further questions: What is the correlation with spending on advertisements, and overall purchase amounts including purchase amounts in specific product categories? How do targeted and non-targeted advertisements for various products impact sales across different product categories? What are the demographic statistics of the towns and cities that the stores are based in? Answering these questions alongside the analysis you are about to view will enhance the positive data infrastructure within your company further cementing it as one of the biggest global supermarket chains. 

The data was cleaned thoroughly whilst I made a detailed Data Dictionary, documenting all decisions made to be clearly recorded for further analysis. I then began to explore it:

Within SQL I identified additional insights related to the objectives of 2Market. First of all, I created the two table “ad_data” and ”marketing_data”, ensuring that all the values were correctly stated in the syntax and making the column/table names lower case. I then started the analysis of the questions posed.
The total spend per product, per country syntax returned some interesting insight:

As you can see overall liquor was the most popular product type for 2Market, with Spain having the highest total spend both on alcohol and in overall. With this information I would recommend heightening the advertisement budget for liquor, and incorporating a celebrity who has their own alcohol brand into the campaigns. They would preferably be Spanish but have a worldwide audience such as Shakira.
